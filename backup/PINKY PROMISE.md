[right after being drafted to the bengals—[ja'marr went from door-to-door on joe's street](https://nypost.com/2022/02/11/jamarr-chase-went-to-wild-lengths-to-live-near-bengals-teammate-joe-burrow/), asking if anyone was willing to sell their house to him so he could live next to joe (very normal thing to do).](https://nypost.com/2022/02/11/jamarr-chase-went-to-wild-lengths-to-live-near-bengals-teammate-joe-burrow/)

Also, after joe moved to his fancy new mansion in 2023, ja'marr apparently moved in next to him a second time??????? which he himself confirmed on twitch after someone in chat wanted to know if he and joe still lived next to each other. and ja'marr's response was that he lives "right next to burrow" (sadly, i don't think there are any clips of this moment, but i Witnessed it live so you're just gonna have to trust me LMAO). here's [a post](https://www.tumblr.com/realtapiocafan/771978337993326592/joe-is-still-neighbors-with-jamarr?source=share) talking about it and some [Professional Analysis](https://www.tumblr.com/cementcornfield/771979115351949312/upon-doing-further-research-it-looks-like-jamarr?source=share).



[Did we ever figure out if Ja'marr actually buy clothes for Joe?](https://www.tumblr.com/chasedeys/773982107622047744/new-to-joemarr-and-i-have-a-question-did-we-ever?source=share)
